rawData <- read.csv(file, header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE) # import source data, in this case the data file has no headers and strings will be used a factors

                    "texture_mean","perimeter_mean",

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
